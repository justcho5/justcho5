### Hi, I'm Justina ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist-engineer who started her career in Biology doing lab work and has slowly crept into the software engineering space with some pitstops along the way. I roamed the academic world studying Biology at MIT and Harvard and Computer Science at EPFL. I spent a couple years in industry as a data scientist using AI to improve IVF and wore many hats from working with data and machine learning models, communicating and collaborating with stakeholders, and contributing to engineering work. I'm passionate about building products and decided to pivot my career towards software development. I wrapped up a batch at the Recurse Center in March 2024 and am now looking for work as a software engineer!
